# 🍃 Leaf Disease Detection Web Application by Data Genies

**Data Genies** presents an advanced solution for **leaf disease detection**, leveraging **YOLOv8** to provide fast and accurate results. Our system allows users to scan plant leaves, analyze disease patterns, and receive treatment recommendations. We are currently developing a **web-based application** to make this technology more accessible to users.

## 📌 Features
- **AI-powered disease detection** using YOLOv8.
- **Upload and scan** images for instant disease identification.
- **Disease history tracking** with analytics and trends.
- **Actionable insights** with symptoms, causes, and treatment recommendations.
- **User-friendly interface** for seamless scanning and diagnosis.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### **1. Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ShinMon-Dev/Data-Genies-Leaf-Disease-Detection.git
cd Data-Genies-Leaf-Disease-Detection
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3. Run the Application**
```sh
python src/main.py
```

## 📸 Example Output
**Disease Scanner:**
- **Take a picture** or **upload an image** for analysis.
- The system detects diseases with confidence scores (e.g., Bacterial Leaf Blight 88%).
- Provides detailed **diagnosis**, including symptoms, causes, and prevention methods.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **YOLOv8** for leaf disease detection.
- **OpenCV & Matplotlib** for image processing.
- **Python** for backend development.
- **MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) - In Development**.
